The documentation up to this point has been using examples from a simple toy graph of 6 vertices and 6 edges. For this section, a more complicated graph structure is used in the examples. A clipped representation (i.e. low weighted edges removed) of this graph is diagrammed below. This graph is a representation of the American band, the "Grateful Dead":http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Grateful_Dead.

In the above Grateful Dead graph, there are vertices and there are edges. The vertices are broken into two sets: songs (e.g. "Dark Star":http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dark_Star_%28song%29, "China Cat Sunflower":http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/China_Cat_Sunflower) and artists (e.g. "Jerry Garcia":http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jerry_Garcia, "Robert Hunter":http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Robert_Hunter_%28lyricist%29). The following itemization describes the properties associated with vertices and edges. 

# vertices
  ** song vertices
    **** type (string): always 'song' for song vertices.
    **** name (string): the name of the song.
    **** performances (integer): the number of times the song was played in concert.
    **** song_type (string): whether the song is a 'cover' song or an 'original'. 
  ** artist vertices
    **** type (string): always 'artist' for artist vertices.
    **** name (string): the name of the artist.
# edges
  ** followed_by (song -> song): if the tail song was followed by the head song in concert.
    **** weight (integer): the number of times these two songs were paired in concert.
  ** sung_by (song -> artist): if the tail song was primarily sung by the head artist.
  ** written_by (song -> artist): if the tail song was written by the head artist.
