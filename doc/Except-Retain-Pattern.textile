In many instances its desirable to traverse to only those elements that have not been seen in a previous step. Specific use cases are: 

* "Who are my friends friends that are not already my friends?" 
* "What is liked by the people that like the same things as me that I don't already like?"

The solution to these types of problems is provided by the except pattern. Its opposite is the retain pattern--only traverse to those vertices that have been seen in a previous step.

```text
gremlin> g = TinkerGraphFactory.createTinkerGraph()                                                               
==>tinkergraph[vertices:6 edges:6]
gremlin> g.v(1).out
==>v[2]
==>v[3]
==>v[4]
gremlin> g.v(1).out.out
==>v[5]
==>v[3]
```

Both the first and the second emit @v[3]@. To ensure that @v[3]@ is not traversed to on the second step, its necessary to save the results seen after the first @out@. There are three high-level pipes called @aggregate@, @except@, and @retain@. In the examples below, @x@ stores all the values seen up to the @aggregate@ step. Note that, everything in @out@ is "drained" into @x@ before going to the next @out@.

```text
gremlin> x = []
gremlin> g.v(1).out.aggregate(x).out.except(x)
==>v[5]
```

```text
gremlin> x = []
gremlin> g.v(1).out.aggregate(x).out.retain(x)
==>v[3]
```

With named steps it is possible to @except@ and @retain@ previously (and actually forward) objects in the pipeline.

```text
gremlin> g.v(1).as('x').out('created').in('created').except('x')
==>v[4]
==>v[6]
```
